This game was created for a school project - all assets used are open source or a license has been aquired for them. 

It is a kitchen themed platfomer - the goal of the game is to 👀:
  -  collect all the ingredients  
  -  'cook' the food by ansering questions
  -   serve the food
  -  complete all levels with a high enough score to pass


the code is very messy and not at all optimised 😁😁😁
I wont be working on the game anymore.
This project scored me the highest grade!!

here is the asset list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DCaKpcZtU4b7eFyZ1_o_Hi04v6Pvcs16Z0E7aHXdNqQ/edit?usp=sharing (not the best a bit lazy)
